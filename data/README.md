*The folders FSD50K.ground_truth/, FSD50K.metadata/ and FSD50K.doc/ are compressed into one zip file each. However, due to their large size, the folders FSD50K.dev_audio/ and FSD50K.eval_audio/ are split into several files. Specifically, FSD50K.dev_audio/ is split into six files (note the last file is not *.z06, but *.zip)*
